Online Library is a simple CRUD web application built using PHP and MySQL, my very first hands-on experience with PHP.
This project was developed as part of a university course on Database Systems Management.

Through this project, I explored core concepts like:  
-Connecting to a MySQL database using mysqli  
-Performing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
-Displaying records using JOIN queries  
-Handling form data in PHP  
-Organizing basic backend logic  

Features  
-Display list of books  
-Display list of authors  
-Add / update / delete books  
-Add / update / delete authors  

**This project is not fully optimized and doesn't use any frameworks.
But I had a lot of fun experimenting with basic PHP and learning how everything works under the hood! <3
